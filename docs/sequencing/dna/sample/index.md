# Sample preparation protocol

The journey from a cellular solution to sequencing-ready DNA involves a series of critical steps, each designed to isolate, purify, and prepare the genetic material for analysis.

-   [Cell lysis](./lysis/)
-   [DNA purification](./purification/)

By meticulously following these steps, researchers can prepare high-quality DNA samples that are optimized for sequencing.
